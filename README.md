# Factorial-Feature
> This project uses Redux reducers, state, and actions to build an adventure game. 

>The state represents the state of the game. It contains the player’s inventory, distance travelled, and time on the road. Each event in the game is represented as an action. Players can gather supplies, travel, and–if they play risky–sometimes tip over the wagon carrying their supplies.
